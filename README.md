# Portfolio Site

A personal portfolio website built with React and React Router, designed to showcase my projects, skills, education, and work experience. The site features a dark mode toggle powered by the Context API, a custom image slider, and dynamic about cards that alternate image and text placement. Built with accessibility in mind and styled using CSS Modules, this site reflects my journey and passion for web development.
